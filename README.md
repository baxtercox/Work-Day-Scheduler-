Work Day Scheduler

This webpage displays an event scheduler that can be used to save past, future, or present work day events. Each time the user adds an event they wish to complete the event is saved in the local sotrage. The past task bars will be red and the current one will be blue and the future task bars are green. Once you save a specific task and refresh the page it is still there. Each workday hour the task bar will be blue depending on what time you are looking at the webpage. This was completed by saving the inputs to the local storage within the application.
